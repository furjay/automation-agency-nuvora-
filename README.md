# NovaFlow AI Automation Landing Page

Single-page marketing site for an AI automation agency. Includes sections for services, process, testimonials, and a clear email-based “Schedule a call” CTA.

## Getting started

1. **Open the site locally**
   - Just open `index.html` in your browser (no build step needed).

2. **Customize your agency details**
   - Update the agency name and tagline in the header and footer inside `index.html`.
   - Replace placeholder testimonials in the `#testimonials` section.

3. **Set your email for scheduling**
   - Search in `index.html` for `hello@youragency.com`.
   - Replace it with your own email address; the buttons use `mailto:` links to open the user’s email client and prefill the subject.

## Deployment

Because this is a static site, you can deploy it on:

- Any static hosting provider (e.g. Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages)
- Your own server or existing website by dropping in `index.html` and `styles.css`

No extra dependencies or runtime are required.
